Other varients. Increasing in complexity.

No units, cash, pval. AT ALL. Reward is if prediction is correct

Pval, units, cash but Reward is related to available. So sell and no units? Negative. Buy and no cash? Negative

Need to capture each variation and compare systematically with shorter epochs on smaller data sets


Duplicate the forked repository and make private!!
Cut test data into short sections, try 10 sessions repeated 10 times

Test with one session input, NO port, unit, cash inputs 

To do that, the the parameters* for functions

Then start simple. 10 memories

Look into cross regulating tests. Basicall find right hidden layers, layer size, learning rate first on small sample sizes then scale up
